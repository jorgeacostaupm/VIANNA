# VANA

VANA (Visual Analytics for Neuropsicological Assesments) is a modular visual analytics environment developed within the AI-Mind project to explore and analyze data from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Designed in close collaboration with clinical researchers, our system adopts a coordinated multiple-view architecture that integrates components for cohort exploration, data wrangling, group comparison, temporal trajectory analysis, and correlation exploration. Importantly, it leverages the hierarchical structure of neuropsychological data to reduce and manage the inherent complexity of such datasets. Through this combination of views, the tool supports intuitive navigation, interactive filtering, and task-specific workflows. By bridging domain-specific needs with a flexible and extensible design, the system advances visual analytics for neuropsicological research and provides a reusable framework for other contexts involving complex tabular datasets.
